    In the Relation Networks algorithm, we first extract feature maps for both support and query
    images. Then we compute the mean of support features for each class (called prototypes).
    To predict the label of a query image, its feature map is concatenated with each class prototype
    and fed into a relation module, i.e. a CNN that outputs a relation score. Finally, the
    classification vector of the query is its relation score to each class prototype.

    Note that for most other few-shot algorithms we talk about feature vectors, because for each
    input image, the backbone outputs a 1-dim feature vector. Here we talk about feature maps,
    because for each input image, the backbone outputs a "feature map" of shape
    (n_channels, width, height). This raises different constraints on the architecture of the
    backbone: while other algorithms require a "flatten" operation in the backbone, here "flatten"
    operations are forbidden.

    Relation Networks use Mean Square Error. This is unusual because this is a classification
    problem. The authors justify this choice by the fact that the output of the model is a relation
    score, which makes it a regression problem. See the article for more details.
